Hey there! I'm Cristian â€” currently working in IT Governance and transitioning into Software Engineering. Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of turning complex processes into smart, scalable solutions through automation, solid architecture, and emerging technologies like AI.
My goal is to go beyond just writing code â€” I want to design intelligent systems that adapt, learn, and deliver real value. With a strategic background in governance, I bring a holistic view to software development, focusing on impact, efficiency, and long-term sustainability.
